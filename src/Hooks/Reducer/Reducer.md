## Overview

The `useReducer` hook is used in this project to manage the state of a simple counter. It allows us to handle different actions (increment, decrement, reset) in a more predictable way compared to `useState`.

### Key Features:
- **Increment Counter**: Increases the count by 1.
- **Decrement Counter**: Decreases the count by 1.
- **Reset Counter**: Resets the counter to its initial value.
